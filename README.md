Essential for tasks like linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and random number generation.

Pandas:

Designed for data manipulation and analysis.
Offers powerful data structures like Series and DataFrame for working with labeled and relational data.
Provides functions and methods for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.
Facilitates tasks like data indexing, grouping, aggregation, and time series analysis.

Matplotlib:

Primary plotting library in Python for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Offers a wide range of plotting functions to create various types of charts, plots, and graphs.
Highly customizable to adjust aspects like colors, styles, labels, and annotations.
Integrates well with other Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data visualization.

MySQL Connector:

Enables Python programs to connect and interact with MySQL databases.
Provides an interface to execute SQL queries, fetch data, and perform database operations.
Supports both MySQL Server and MySQL Cluster.
Allows for secure and efficient data retrieval and manipulation in Python applications.
